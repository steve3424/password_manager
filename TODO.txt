- BUG: with a single entry (open or closed), scroll bar jumps to top once I scroll down enough to hit the sticky add entry section

- Style up entry form
	-- entry form and new entry form should be basically the same, maybe different sized or colors
- Edit entry
- Delete entry
- Add backend validations to new entry form
- Make sure the lengths I'm enforcing are correct for all forms
- Complete DB set up script
- Add eyeball functionality to new entry password

- Should I use html forms at all since I am clearing them out or just send json?
    -- I would have to do all of the redirection in Javascript
- How to do loading screen on vault page for large vaults
- Maybe I can make error messages more dynamic instead of having so much HTML. I could have the HTML for the flash messages, but dynamically create the JS ones?
