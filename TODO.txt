- BUG: with a single entry (open or closed), scroll bar jumps to top once I scroll down enough to hit the sticky add entry section
- Add backend validations to new entry form
- Make sure the lengths I'm enforcing are correct for all forms
- Actually save new entries with iv's
- If flask validation is hit on registration, make sure that tab is selected on redirect
- Maybe I can make error messages more dynamic instead of having so much HTML. I could have the HTML for the flash messages, but dynamically create the JS ones?
