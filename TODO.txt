- BUG: with a single entry (open or closed), scroll bar jumps to top once I scroll down enough to hit the sticky add entry section
- Add backend validations to new entry form
- Make sure the lengths I'm enforcing are correct for all forms
- Actually save new entries with iv's
- If flask validation is hit on registration, make sure that tab is selected on redirect
