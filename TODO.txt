- NEXT: Properly display users vault

- BUG: with a single entry (open or closed), scroll bar jumps to top once I scroll down enough to hit the sticky add entry section

- Add backend validations to new entry form
- Make sure the lengths I'm enforcing are correct for all forms
- If flask validation is hit on registration, make sure that tab is selected on redirect
- Maybe I can make error messages more dynamic instead of having so much HTML. I could have the HTML for the flash messages, but dynamically create the JS ones?
- Complete DB set up script
- Should I use html forms at all since I am clearing them out or just send json?
    -- I would have to do all of the redirection in Javascript
